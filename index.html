            <p>Nothing Can Go Wrong is a design exploration in indirect control and consequence-driven planning. Instead of piloting the protagonist moment-to-moment, players design a route and then watch their plan unfold, for better or worse, as environmental objects react in surprising ways. The appealâ€”and the difficultyâ€”comes from predicting emergent interactions while still feeling empowered by a plan that was yours. My responsibilities covered concept ideation, systems design, engineering, and integration of artist-created assets in Godot. The core loop began with a lightweight pathing tool, but the heart of the experience emerged from environmental â€˜verbsâ€™: train tracks, whirlpools, spring pads, trapdoors, and chain reactions that could delight or derail. Balancing readability with surprise required strict rules and effective feedback animation that help the player learn the worldâ€™s grammar. Difficulty tuning was driven by data rather than guesswork; I exposed parameters for moving speeds, impulse strength, and trigger sequencing, allowing tight loops of testâ€“tweakâ€“test within the jamâ€™s limited timeframe. The art pass focused on clarity and charm: silhouettes that read at a glance, restrained palettes, and motion that communicates function. We achieved a polished, playable demo on schedule and ranked in the top 20% overall. Post-jam, Iâ€™d extend the system with better text and visual explanation so players can gradually learn the mechanics, add optional objectives for mastery, and implement robust replays to encourage sharing. Most importantly, the project validated a personal design interest: agency through foresight. When players laugh at a plan that almost workedâ€”and instantly want to iterateâ€”youâ€™ve got a loop worth growing.</p>

          <h3>Gyrotris â€” Godot â€” <a href="https://strikeoo.itch.io/gyrotris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play on itch.io</a></h3>

            <p>Gyrotris is a sci-fi puzzle game that reimagines the core mechanics of Tetris through the addition of rotating boards and dynamic gravity. Set aboard a spaceship trapped in the gravitational pull of a black hole, the playerâ€™s task is to clear unstable cargo while managing an unpredictable gravity core. The gameâ€™s twist lies in periodic board rotations, random obstacles from space debris, and the use of limited repair robots to fix holes in the board. These hazards puncture the grid at timed intervals or after clearing lines, preventing pieces from settling normally.
              
            Developed entirely by me for Untitled Game Jam #100, Gyrotris was built in Godot Engine 4.3 with pixel art assets created in Piskel. This was my first complete game, and I handled all design, programming, and art. Core mechanics include classic Tetris-like piece movement and rotation, enhanced by environmental challenges. Additional features such as time-stop (holding SHIFT while rotating the board) give players strategic breathing room, while repair robotsâ€”earned by clearing rowsâ€”offer recovery options.
              
            Though the UI and animation are minimal, Gyrotris demonstrates my ability to merge familiar mechanics with new twists, implement functional prototypes quickly, and iterate based on feedback. Planned improvements include animating board rotation for clarity and deciding whether holes should rotate with the board. Gyrotris ultimately reflects my focus on transforming established game formulas into distinctive, engaging experiences.</p>

            <p>The Aegis Sword project is a detailed 3D replication of the weapon from Xenoblade Chronicles 2, completed as the final project for EAS 143: Introduction to Solid Modeling at the University of Rochester. Using OnShape CAD, I reproduced its intricate, asymmetrical designâ€”symbolizing the character Pyraâ€™s fragmented pastâ€”by applying modular modeling techniques for clean topology and precise detailing. This work refined my skills in translating abstract artistic concepts into production-ready assets, balancing visual fidelity with structural practicality. The techniques developed here form a strong foundation for creating immersive, story-driven 3D assets in future game development projects.</p>
